    "**Two File Types: Text and Binary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of programming, we can broadly categorize files into two types: text files, which hold data that is human-readable, and binary files, containing data that isn't intended for direct human interpretation. Our main emphasis throughout this course will be text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operating system only see's bytes**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to note that, for an operating system, all files, whether text or binary, are merely sequences of bytes stored on a disk. The operating system does not possess the ability to understand the significance of these bytes. The onus falls upon the application to interpret these bytes correctly. This necessitates the application's awareness of the bytes' encoding, ensuring their accurate interpretation as intelligible text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Encoding and Decoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encodings denote the mappings between raw binary data (comprised of 0's and 1's) and text characters. If a text file encoded using a certain encoding is decoded using a different encoding, it can result in the transformation of the output text, sometimes to the point of illegibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding/Decoding is Application Dependent**\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoding of a file is defined by the application creating the file. During both file creation and file reading, the application must clearly specify the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding Standards Exist**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there exist standard (and some non-standard) encoding techniques. ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-16 are among the most prevalently used encoding techniques, enabling representation of a vast character set and promoting interoperability among varying systems and languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding encoding/decoding of text files is important**\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers and programmers, understanding the concept of file encoding is vital, as it plays an indispensable role in ensuring that data, when working with text files, is interpreted and displayed correctly.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Hexidemical**\n",
    "A byte can be depicted in hexadecimal format. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system that uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent the values 0-15. Hexadecimal is widely employed in computing, given its more readable format compared to binary. Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits (2^4 = 16). Consequently, two hexadecimal digits can represent a byte (2^8 = 256).\n",

The following diagram shows the byte representation of the number 0x12345678 in both big-endian and little-endian formats.\n",

It's therefore crucial to have a clear understanding of these concepts, especially when working with low-level programming, computer networks, or systems that interact with hardware directly."

Unicode includes characters from a plethora of languages worldwide, making it a comprehensive global standard.\n",

    "UTF-8 employs a variable-length encoding scheme, where each character can be represented by 1-4 bytes. This adaptability makes UTF-8 efficient for a wide range of use-cases, and particularly suited to languages where most characters fall within the ASCII range, as these can be represented using just a single byte. UTF-8 is backward compatible with both ASCII and Unicode, which means ASCII characters can be read accurately by UTF-8 systems, and UTF-8 characters by Unicode systems.\n",

    "Conversely, UTF-16 also uses a variable-length encoding scheme but each character is represented by either 2 or 4 bytes, depending on the character. This is generally more efficient for scripts (like many East Asian scripts) where most characters fall outside of the ASCII range.
